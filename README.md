# This is the README.md file for the **github-final-project**

A calculator that calculates simple interest given principal, annual rate of interest and time period in years.

Input:
   p, principal amount
   t, time period in years
   r, annual rate of interest
Output
   simple interest = p*t*r

## Formula

Simple Interest = Principal × Rate × Time

## Example

If:
p = 1000  
r = 0.05  
t = 2  

Then:

Simple Interest = 1000 × 0.05 × 2  
Simple Interest = 100

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone <repository-url>

2. Navigate to the project folder

3. Run the program in your preferred environment

## Project Purpose

This project was created as part of a GitHub and open-source collaboration exercise to demonstrate version control, repository structure, and documentation best practices.

## Future Improvements

- Add compound interest calculation
- Add user input validation
- Convert into a web-based calculator
- Add automated tests
